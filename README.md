## How to use Mask-RCNN with Tensorflow 2 on Windows 10
Mask-RCNN is only available on Tensorflow 1, to use Tensorflow 2, follow the instructions here:

It's basically cloning a fork —created by [Adam Kelly](https://github.com/akTwelve)— of the original Mask-RCNN repository. It works perfectly on Tensorflow 2.3 with Cuda 10.1 on Windows 10.
